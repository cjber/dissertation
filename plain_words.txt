 usage within the United Kingdom has been steadily increasing by year with the highest ever billion vehicle miles (bvm) travelled in  [million;][]{departmentfortransport. Characterised by tall hedgerows and winding turns, rural roads in the UK are often unsuitable for higher traffic flow due to the obstruction of view due to the protected hedgerows, narrow lanes and often poor condition. Due to the abundance of these roads, with "Unclassified" local network roads making up The Rural Urban Classification defines a rural area as one outside a settlements with more than  resident population therefore a road could be considered rural, if either connecting or present within small settlements in the UK. This study will focus particualrly on rural connecting roads, outside of rural towns.  A Governmental review of speed policy considered the need for the role of speed and accidents on rural roads to be further considered suggesting a framework for individaul classification of roads, taking into account local considerations of the road to implement more suitable speed limits. In  draft guidance for rural roads was presented by the Department for Transport suggested a blanket reduction in rural single carriageway road speed limits from ph to ph including a reduction to ph for lower quality A and B roads However, this draft guidance has yet to be implemented, likely due to the costs involved in a blanket change in speed limits. For example, the estimated cost for a complete change in national speed limits from imperial to metric in Ireland cost an estimated â‚¬million in speed limit signs alone These costs suggest that an alternative to blanket implementation is required.  National speed limits have seen little variation for a number of years, with the majority of roads following the broad criteria for the three main roads types. The three national speed limits are: the mph speed limit on roads with street lighting (sometimes referred to as Restricted Roads) the national speed limit of mph on single carriageway roads the national speed limit of mph on dual carriageways and motorways. These limits are set by the UK government, however local speed limits are determined by local councils.  outline in that national speed limits are not appropriate for all roads, where local road conditions present the requirement for alternative speed limits. The majority of the rural road network in the UK follows the national speed limit of ph for single carriagway roads, and pg for dual carriageway roads, despite driver speed often being far below the speed limit. Noted as especially common on C and Unclassified roads due to the narrow roads, bend, junctions and access. In  an estimated suggest that selecting alternative speed limits for single carriageway rural roads should consider: History of collisions The road's function Existing mean traffic speed Use by vulnerable road users The road's geometry and function The road environment, including roadside development The Road Safety Management Capacity Review  outlines the current limitations with road safety management, with the lack of defined and measureable safety performance framework, noting that such a framework should set out the long term goal of total prevention of road deaths and injuries, achieving this through a reduction in average speeds on different road types, and an improvement in emergency response times. This review states that at present there is a distinct lack of both urban and rural road hiararchies, which could be used to better match appropriate speed limits, with function, layout and design. Again, this review notes that posted speed limits often allow for speed far in excess of the design limits of single carriageway rural roads, with inappropriate but alloable speed often a contributing factor in rural accidents. Finally the report calls for a review on national speed limits as soon as possible.  A recent development for guidance in setting local speed limits is the prduction of the This tool provides an automated method for the introduction of new speed limits for local councils. This tool takes observed traffic flow, accidents, speeds, descriptive information regarding the network and current costs, outputting prediced changed in these data for various speed limit changes. While this tool introduces some quantiative method for individual road speed limit assessments, it misses some key features outlined in past government framework proposals [][e.g.]{departmentfortransport, particularly in relation to road geometry. LiDAR data is collected by emitting rapid laser pulses from an aircraft towards the ground which are reflected back, measuring the distance between the aircraft and surface objects at up to  measurements per second This method produces a set of highly accurate three dimensional points which collectively are known as a LiDAR point 'cloud'. As LiDAR data detects all surface objects, the resultant point cloud produced will include all natural and man made structures, including buildings, roads, trees in addition to the natural variation in the terrain height, known as a digital surface model The main features unique to LiDAR, as opposed to similar aerial data collection techniques such as true colour imagery are outlined below: LiDAR systems record the data by recording emitting a laser pulse which is reflected back at the aircraft by ground objects. If the laser hits a solid object such as ground or a building roof, this laser pulse is entirely reflected back towards the aircraft, giving a single point. However, if the laser pulse hits a soft object such as a tree canopy, the pulse may be partially returned, giving multiple return pulses Therefore, these multiple pulse returns give information regarding objects at an exact  location, but with varying  locations. LiDAR systems also give intensity values for return pulses, which gives information regarding the reflectance of the surface of objects that are hit by the laser pulses. If intensity is given  then reflectance  may be represented as  where  refers to the first pulse signal intensity In addition to  and  coordinates, the distance between the plane and the reflected ground or object is recorded and assigned a  value. Rural roads in the UK are often characterised by dense hedgerows either side, often containing large oak trees which extend over the road surface. In addition to the reduction in corner visibility on these roads, standard aerial imagery suffers from the road surface being obscured by shadows from these trees, and the tree canopy itself. Aerial imagery also often suffers from obstruction due to clouds Due to the inclusion of pulses with modern LiDAR data, the road surface can often be detected through the canopy by selecting the final pulse values, additionally the infrared laser pulses have smaller shadows, due to the narrow scanning angle of LiDAR Non LiDAR imagery often suffers from scene complexity, where road patterns, vehicles and lane markings reduce road heterogeneity The value information provided by LiDAR data allows for the separation of ground and objects on the surface, meaning roads and buildings are often easily separated, despite having similar reflectance (or intensity) Additionally, the reflectance of roads is often homogeneous, and distinctly separate from vegetation LiDAR lacks any texture or spectral information, and often studies in road detection have combined LiDAR with imagery to alleviate this issue with the inclusion of luminescence information to aid with road classification [e.g.][]{charaniya. LiDAR points are distributed irregularly and with varying density, with point density often higher where flight strips overlap and tall objects can occlude points, leaving limited data surrounding trees or buildings.  Often studies use LiDAR height data to identify kerbs to separate streets from pavement however rural roads often have no kerb, and are at the same level as the surrounding vegetation if they are managed grass verges LiDAR data often requires a large amount of processing due to the irregular distribution of points, presence of noise and the number of variables that have to be considered,  note that often papers do not include the computational time for processing this data, which can be time consuming. [H] [width=]{figure area_map [Study are highlighting road locations]{Study are highlighting road locations} This paper will present a method for rural road extraction for a region in the North West of England. The methodology is produced in order to ensure scalability and automation, allowing for replication for any area where data is available. Data used will include road centreline geometries, LiDAR point cloud, and aerial imagery to extract road widths through linear probability models. Additionally, this paper aims to extract other features of roads such as elevation changes, surface quality, and the sharpness of bends. These key features aim to provide information that may inform the selection of appropriate speed limits on rural roads, where the ph national speed limit is inappropriate.  Key Aims: Produce and assess an automated method using LiDAR, aerial imagery and OS road geometry to determine the true width of roads within the chosen study area. Using OS Road and LiDAR Data produce an automated method for determining the characteristic of roads that relate to overall road quality. Assess the potential for speed reduction on rural roads, with the assumption that at present the roads chosen are ph. The site selected in this study was chosen to include a selection of A, B, and Unclassified local roads within a rural setting. Particularly the roads chosen are often partially obscured by tree canopies and do not have visible kerbs, both key features in rural British roads.  This paper is organised into chapters, first a literature review, outlining the broad implications of speed limits, rural road networks, and object extraction particuarly in relation to LiDAR aerial point clouds. Second, a detailed description of the methodology involved in this paper will outline the techniques used to classify road widths, in addition to the other road geometric information. A results section will primarily assess the method for road extraction, through sensitivity analysis and some qualitative observations, a short section will then explore the findings. Finally a discussion will detail the implications for the findings, and suggest areas for improvement. improve this, why am i doing this, e.g. production of method will aid speed limits, emergency response etc. Include more infrastructure to support the overarching narrative argument. E.g.

Given the pressure for full quantitative assessments of the current speed limits in the rural network in the United Kingdom, there is a demand to produce comprehensive methods for rural road feature extraction. This paper primarily focuses on techniques for assessing the road geometry for roads considered to be rural connecting roads in the United Kingdom. This literature review will first outline the current understanding of the rural road network, considering the role of speed and speed limits in accident likelihood, rural accessibility, and a detailed look at current road extraction techniques involving aerial imagery and LiDAR, presenting the key differences and limitations of these studies when considering the rural road network in the UK. Road Geometry, from documentation of both road geometry and road environment. Road geometry means the parameters used for the geometric design of roads, such as design speed, stopping sight distance, passing sight distance, line of sight, number of lanes, lane width, side foot path for pedestrians, longitudinal and transverse slope, road pavement materials, etc. Recently built roads follow modern geometric design parameters, and most of this information is already available, but for the oldest roads these data, which are required mostly for upgrading or assessing the quality of the roads, are unavailable or unusable. By road environment we refer to the vicinity of the road on both sides of the road, including buildings, trees, vegetation, electricity, traffic signs, traffic light poles and other objects We expect that the geometry of this kind of road environment can best be obtained either using airborne or vehiclebased laser scanning or using an integrated approach combining both systems. Supported with imaging sensors, the documentation can be completed with texture information, traffic sign semantics, etc. How many roads are "rural", how much traffic Describe for the UK. conducted a comprehensive study outlining the key features of British rural roads, in an effort to improve the characterstics associated with accident rates, above that which was explored by the MASTER study which primarily consisted of European road data, with limited data for England identify key features of selected rural british roads across England which they use to classify roads into certain categories, this data was obtained through drive through video recordings. The following data was obtained and used to categorise the quality of the road; Type of junction (if present); Number and type of minor junctions; Number and type of accesses within the section; Number of bends, classified into: Sharp (bends with a warning sign); medium; slight Lighting; Reflecting road studs; Kerbs; Number of lanes; Road markings; Land use. Visibility; Verge width and type; Roadside type; Notably, the features unique to rural roads were observed to be the land use either side of a road, consisting mainly of residential, farming, wooded, open or industrial. Verges consisting of grass verges, pavement, low banks, ditches or none. Roadside type included the most dominant vertical feature closest to the road, including trees which may overhang the road, hedges, banks, fences and so on. This study also manually measured the road width for each site, and to determine the "hilliness" of roads, the number of  contour lines crossed were counted to give the total change in height. found that the average width of British rural roads varied from  to m with a mean width or m. Most were two lane roads, however a small number were single track. The mean length of roads was m, around half the sites had more than bends per km with third showing severe bend per km. Most roads were flat, showing less than a  rise per km.  Road quality in this assessment was determined through categorising roads into four key groups: Group  Roads which are very hilly, with a high bend density and low traffic speed. Group  Roads with a high access density, above average bend density and below average traffic speed. Group  Roads with a high junction density, but below average bend density and hilliness, and above average traffic speed. Group  Roads with a low density of bends, junctions and accesses and a high traffic speed. This study therefore attempted to outline a rural road hierarchy in relation to road function, and certain road geometries, which addresses issues outlined in the Government's review of speed policy However, due to the nature of the data collection for this study, time constraints mean that producing a full road hierarchy for all rural roads within England is impractical and requires a review of the methodology. Additionally the speed policy review notes that road hierarchies should inform appropriate speeds for each road. See Accidents on rural roads often occur within the mph speed limit meaning a distinction between what is an appropriate speed should be made that does not relate to a given speed limit.  suggest a distinction between both  and  speed.  when driving above the speed limit, and therefore directly breaking the law,  speed; driving too fast for the conditions of the road, not necessarily above the speed limit, often considered dangerous driving. A study by the  assessed the impact of inappropriate speed on rural roads, which contributed to The Department for Transport found that rural roads account for around Lowering the speed limit on roads has been shown to result in an overall reduction in the average speed of vehicles. found that a reduction in the speed limit of a road resulted in a mean speed reduction of around one quarter of the difference, noting that drivers will often obey speed limits that they determine to be reasonable. A reduction in average speed subsequently leads to a reduction in road traffic accidents, produced the EURO model to predict accident frequencies given the proportion of drivers exceeding the speed limit and the average speed, finding that excess speed and a higher speed limit were both associated with a higher accident frequency.  Particularly, the risk of death at various speeds has been assessed in various studies, found that at ph the risk of a driver dying in a head on collision between two cars is around demonstrated that traffic flow, link length, and the number of minor junctions all directly increased the number of accidents, while wider roads were associated with a reduction in the number of accidents. The assessed road geometry and other features of roads, however road data for the United Kingdom was limited to a small area in the South East, suggesting that a comprehensive methodology for the extraction of UK rural road geometry is required for a more comprehensive study.  Developed speed tool:  Straightforward method for determining appropriate speed limits.Forcasting speed reduction and therefore accident reduction with revised speed limits. Does not take into account road geometry etc. Rural accessibility can be defined in terms of economic and social opportunity as the proximity or ability for spatial interaction In relation to transport specifically, accessibility may be defined as the ability or opportunities by which basic services can be reached by either public or private transportation Journey time on rural roads is often a primary concern when considering a reduction in speed limits, often higher speed is perceived to bring with it shorter travel times, and greater accessibility for people and goods Despite this, there is evidence to support that traffic travelling at constant, and lower speeds may result in overall more reliable journey times, and the time saved by travelling at faster speed is often overestimated Despite this, transport accessibility for rural communities is far more limited than for urban communities, where often rural areas have limited or no public transport, meaning there is a heavy reliance on personal transport Accessibility in this context can be defined as the transport facility or opportunities with which basic services can be reached from a given location by using a certain transport system There has been little focus on the improvement of transport technologies in rural areas, with the potential for new technologies implemented into urban areas improving rural accessibility A key area to address is the level of accessibility to hospital services for rural communities, where recent centralisation of these services has negatively impacted the level of access for rural communities This also impacts the level of access for hospital services to reach rural areas, where distance and time taken to a hospital directly correlates with a patients mortality Emergency vehicles are often larger than personal vehicles and as such it can be assumed that accessibility for these types of services is often more limited depending on the quality of rural roads. conducted a study outlining the key transport and technological challenges that limit accessibility within rural areas, demonstrating that the quality of rural infrastructure, and access to services are key factors driving social exclusion and limited access to goods and services.  suggest that technological innovations targeting rural areas may alleviate this problem through the production of user generated data, they note that certain challenges will come with this technology, notably their first point; Understanding basic technological infrastructure requirements in rural areas. Suggesting a greater understanding of the existing rural road infrastructure is required before the introduction of existing rural technologies may improve access to rural areas.

When the road has been constructed, documentation of road information is needed for an increasing number of other applications, such as noise modelling, road safety, road maintenance, locationbased services, and car and pedestrian navigation. Documentation of the road environment includes documentation of both road geometry and road environment. Road geometry means the parameters used for the geometric design of roads, such as design speed, Aerial LiDAR classification typically follows two objectives, the classification of ground and nonground points, and the classification of surface objects, including buildings, trees or roads Classification takes two forms,  and supervised classification taking a  dataset and using it to estimate the paramaters associated with the outcome hoping to be classified. These parameters are then used on unknown data, with a similar distribution to the training set, and used to classify features Most past work on the classification of LiDAR data has been produced through unsupervised classification, where no training dataset is provided, often producing a coarse classification than could be obtained through supervised classification.  from Early LiDAR classification primarily focused on the production of digital terrain models (DTM),  used an iterative linear prediction algorithm which used residuals to compute weights for each point. Ground points produced residuals with negative weigthing, and vegetation was more likely to produce residuals with higher weighting. From this proposed a laser pulse filtering technique for distinguising laser points that were reflected from buildings and vegetation, than those from ground, weights were assigned to points, determined by an assigned acceptible height difference between two neighrbouring points. Limitations at the time of this study meant that processing requires points to be aggregated into a grid for processing, resulting in significant information loss. Results were generally good for the simplicity of the method, giving a RMS error of m, however  note that this error likely does not reflect the true precision of the DEM, which may be slightly worse.  The observation of height textures are another method for DEM extraction enabled through the use of LiDAR data.  used height variation between neighbouring LiDAR points to classify buildings, trees, and flat terrain, with enough detail to detemrine whether a building had a flat or sloped roof. Similarly noted that man made structures often have smooth, regular height textures, with small variations in height, while trees and other vegetation give an irregular height pattern. Empirical assessment of the accuracy of their technique resulted in a used morphological filtering of points assigned into a regular grid by inputting a minimum elevation for each cell in the grid, and interpolating the elevation of cells not containing any points. Accuracy of the results were assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively, giving This paper will utilise a recent method for DEM production in order to classify ground and non ground points for subsequent road classification. The method chosen was proposed by  uses  to generate a DTM from LiDAR data. This algorithm, unlike other filtering algorithms, allows for a simplistic input, without the need for numerous parameters to ensure an accurate DTM. This method consists of four main steps: A cloth is placed above the inverted LiDAR measurements. The displacement of each LiDAR point is calculated under the influence of gravity, meaning some points appear below ground measurements. For any points detected as being under the ground, they are moved to ground level and set to be unmovable. Movable points are moved according to neighbouring points. Quantitative accuracy of this methodology gave results similar to top existing DTM production algorithms, but with a far more simplistic implementation. Developments in LiDAR enabled the possibility of classification by using laser intensity information and multiple returns, features of more advanced LiDAR systems. The TopEye system used by  allowed for  classification of buildings and electrical powerlines using reflectance to obtain radiometric information about the area and note that this can be used to separate paved area from grassland. Power lines in particular benefited from the multiple returns produced by the LiDAR system used as they often gave one return from the power line, and one from ground. if i want more,...

Road classification is essentially a data clustering method to categorise data into road and nonroad points, enabled through discovering patterns and relationship between variables and validation of findings  Clustering may be achieved through various algorithms, categorised generally into partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, densitybased methods, gridbased methods, and modelbased methods note that the periodic assessment of roads is greatly important due to the increasing traffic load, and new automated techniques will enable this in areas where in the past it had not been feasible. Due to the heterogeneous nature of certain roads types, the road environment is often complex, meaning collection and accurate processing of road features is challenging.  Road classification methodologies have historically used purely aerial imagery, providing only road pixels and  location information used high resolution satellite imagery for road centreline extraction from a suburban area based on cluster coverage. They used image segmentation through maximum likelihood to assign pixels to road and nonroad classes, making the assumption that both classes gave a Gaussian distribution. Features for classification include the angular secondmovement, contrast, and entropy of the image, based off image texture analysis by Results of the classification gave significant noise, noted as a possibility due to non conformance with a Gaussian distribution, however, centreline extraction from the resultant classification removed any pixels with low density and ran a means clustering algorithm iteratively to determine road clusters.  produced an automated method for mapping urban and suburban roads using high resolution satellite imagery, using spectral, context, shape and the structural features or roads. Using fuzzy segmentation, classification of buildings, parking areas, and road clusters were obtain, but with large levels of noise. Angular texture analysis was able to reduce this noise, however large areas of incorrectly classified roads appear present results. Additionally, while not mentioned in this study, the method proposed fails to address the differentiation between road and pavement, a key issue with the use of  imagery. Several methods for road classification from LiDAR follow similar patterns, first identification of ground points through height data, and DTM extraction through interpolation, and subsequent classification based on the attributes of the point cloud Due to the  information provided by LiDAR data, kerbs can be segmented from roads, achieving a more accurate road edge location when kerbs are present. However, due to the often small jump between kerb and road, this methodology is limited to new terrestrial mobile LiDAR data collection. produced a methodology using mobile LiDAR data to classify road edges by segmenting kerbstones based on the height gradient along the scanned profile, with a final completeness of used low flying airborne LiDAR point cloud data with a very high density of Road Edge Detection:  Vosselman developed a method for detecting kerbstones from airborne LiDAR data, based on the detection of small height jumps caused byt he kerbstones in the LiDAR point cloud data.

Traditional road extraction techniques from aerial imagery relied on human extraction that is both time consuming and prone to inaccuracy However, recent improvements in remote sensing technology now mean that automated extraction techniques have been explored which rely on the much higher resolution imagery available This paper will use Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, made available by the UK government for much of England. LiDAR is collected by measuring the distance from an aircraft to the ground, emitting laser pulses at regular intervals allowing for very high resolution terrain models to be produced, with a resolution up to m. Additionally the 'point clouds' produced by the laser pulses contain information that may be utilised to determine the qualities that are indicative of road locations [e.g.][]{clode.  Additionally, luminescence information extracted from m resolution aerial true colour imagery is available for research purposes for the entirety of the UK.

The canopy above roads may be excluded through ignoring early pulses (higher Z values), therefore only the last pulse values for any point are selected, this can be expressed as; where  is a single instance of a LiDAR point within the chosen point cloud,  is the last pulse  coordinate,  the last pulse  coordinate,  the last pulse  coordinate, and  the last pulse intensity value. Ground points were classified using the Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) algorithm, as described in Points were already classified in the data provided, however, as the classification technique was unknown, reclassification was considered necessary. The general implementation simulates the movements of a piece of cloth lying over the inverse of a point cloud, as the point cloud is flipped, the cloth settles beneath ground points, while covering points that lie separate to the ground, essentially forming a digital terrain model (DTM), cloth simulations are described in more detail in  and subsection The CSF algorithm is given; where is the mass of a single LiDAR point (set to is the time step between points and  represents the gravity constant.  With the classification of ground points, (given a full DTM may be produced through spatial interpolation of the classified points. This process is called normalisation, and ensures that when extracting height information, any observed values are due to objects on the surface of the terrain, and not due to the lie of the terrain itself. Interpolation uses the inverse distance weighting and  nearest neighbours algorithms to produce the DTM. Nearest neighbours were selected as with  for the inverse weighting, and used to produce a DTM with a resolution of This particular technique was selected over more comprehensive methods such as kriging as the number of points is very high, and the small benefit was considered minimal compared with the increase in computational load. The  values from the DTM were then subtracted from the LiDAR point cloud, leaving a normalised point cloud. With the normalised last pulse point cloud, the point cloud was clipped to within a  extent of each known road location, using the OS road shapefiles. Selecting a  extent ensured that even with slight inaccuracy in road location, the road LiDAR points would likely not be excluded. A large number of unimportant points were therefore removed, saving on computational resources. Additionally this extent ensured that both road and non road points were included, but reduced the chance of false positives from occuring as fewer non road points were now included in the analysis. This section combines data extracted through the OS road shapefiles preprocessed LiDAR data, and aerial imagery to obtain a set of creteria to assess the chosen road network. These criteria are; Road Width Bend Sharpness Road Steepness Surface Quality [H]  OS Roads Data Summary} p{m}} Example\\  id idEECADFEBE\ endNode idFCAABF\\ startNode idCECDBAAA\\ roadNumberTOID osgb\ roadNameTOID fictitious FALSE\\ roadClassification B Road\\ roadFunction B Road\\ formOfWay Single Carriageway\\ length loop FALSE\\ primaryRoute FALSE\\ trunkRoad FALSE\\ roadClassificationNumber B\ name& name& roadStructure The LiDAR point cloud data was sampled at regular meter intervals for each road, perpendicular to the road direction, ensuring that when road directin changed, the sampling locations remained perpendicular. Each road was first split into nodes at which road direction changes, and from this, points at meter intervals between two connected nodes were calculated; where  is the interval value which increases by meters until the length of the total distance of the node, given I_k (L_k T_k L_&= T_k T_{k E where  is the distance from the start of the node to the current sample line position,  is total length of all nodes within a road from the start of the road and  is the euclidean distance between two nodes.  To calculate the sample locations, perpendicular to the roads, first the  and  euclidean distances from a reference point  and the end of the current node  were calculated; len p_k)} len_n (n len)  (n_{k+  p_k) from this, the lengths were inverted, giving two points of distance  from Inversion was achieved by subtracting the given value from while adding the value, and vice versa. These perpendicular sample lines were buffered to a width of giving a total area of  per sample and spatially joined to the existing LiDAR point cloud data, removing any points that fell outside the sample lines. With the perpendicular sample lines extracted for the length of every road, to assist with the prediction of correct road locations, true colour aerial imagery was included. This imagery was first converted from three band RGB raster images, to a singleband greyscale raster brick with values ranging to  considered to be luminescence information. To exclude as much noise as possible from both the LiDAR point cloud intensity information, and aerial luminescence, only points with the ground classification and points with only a single laser return pulse were included in the models Individual linear probability models were constructed for each sample location for each road, giving results for a cluster of points across a perpendicular segment of each road every Road centrelines were selected as the outcome variable, provided by the OS road network line shapefiles, buffered to  to ensure a three dimensional cross section of points. Additionally, global linear probability models were constructed, and compared against the individual linear models.  Models were constructed using a maximal approach, selecting all appropriate predictor variables, iterating through models by removing variables that did not significantly influence the model outcome, or created noise.  An additional variable  was included, representing the shortest distance from a point to the centreline of the road it is associated with, considering that road points should be weighted more towards points that are closer to the centrepoint of the road.  Predictions for each point were then ran using each model, which gave the likelihood a point was either road or non road. As the likelihood values from the predictions gave a range of numerical values, points that fell below a certain threshold were removed, leaving only points that were most likely correctly identified as road points. This threshold was selected as the _iA__AA_K__ HypotenuseO_K OppositeO_K |K__  cos()(a_{x}, a_{y})B(b_{x}, b_{y})ANB (b_{, b_{)=(a_{+r a_{+r rAB =a_{}{b_{a_{} b_{a_{, b_{a_{) )ABBC ANBC^z^ZlpzIntensity^ZlpzIntensityi$ [H]  Correlation Matrix} Variable Width Max Angle Max Z Int Range\\  Width Max Angle Max Z Int Range [width=]{figure unnamedchunk if there is time:  Use width and max bend sharpness to estimate required speed for required stopping distance. Some maths could be involved. Use to produce speed limit assessment, include steepness somehow (speed limits due to stwwpwnss etc) notes The idea now is to use this information in a more sensitive segmentation, trying to extract the true road extents. Of course, when there is no C(height) or C(inclination) discontinuity at the road boundaries, there is no way de tecting it using laser scan data, and other data sources such as aerial images have to be used. However, the question is how reliable even small discontinuities can be detected. For example, a road may be bounded by an embankment, which usually is a relatively large structure. It may on the other hand be separated from the pavement or a traffic is land by a kerb of only cm in height. This seems to be hopeless, since it is close to the expected noise of the laser measurement. However, if one considers profiles per pendicular to the road, the point is that a m wide road, scanned with m density, will yield measurements to estimate the road surface (assumed to be planar), leading to a standard deviation of about cm cm.  Assessment strategy: assessing the results of an image processing work flow usually a textual description. but results can't be compared easily. Heipkesugest a comparison between methods numerically, ratios derived from statistical test theory:  be identiged. True positive (TP) A phenomenon that is present within the input data and that has successfully been identiged within the output data. False positive (FP) A phenomenon that is not present within the input data but that has falsely been found to be a phenomenon by the algorithm. Thus it is written to output data. False negative (FN) A phenomenon that is present within the input data but that has not been identiged by the algorithm and therefore has been omitted from the output data. Then we degne Completeness by Completeness TP TP FN This is obvious and can directly be taken from degnition of TP and FN. Furthermore we degne Correctness by Correctness TP TP FP This is easy to see since we expect results not to contain features which are erroneous in a way that they contain features which are not present within input data. However, it is implied within this statement that we neglect those cases where features are present within the input data but are missing in the output. Finally Quality is degned by Quality TP TP FP FN This can be considered as a kind of global measure for overall assessment of obtained results. It comprises e ects caused by both false positives and false negatives. Some but not all of the algorithms investigated in this paper use an assessment that is based on the above mentioned measures. Their results are reproduced where available. Otherwise, assessment is done by means of a textual description. Mention logistic regression, considered but not used as results not better and requries a payoff.

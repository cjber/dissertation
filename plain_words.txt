 usage within the United Kingdom has been steadily increasing by year with the highest ever billion vehicle miles travelled in (million) Characterised by tall hedgerows and winding turns, rural roads in the UK are often unsuited higher traffic flow, due to the obstruction of view due to the protected hedgerows, narrow lanes and often poor condition. The abundance of these roads, with "Unclassified" local network roads making up The Rural Urban Classification defines a rural area as one outside a settlements with more than  resident population therefore a road could be considered rural, if either connecting or present within small settlements in the UK. this study will focus particualrly on rural connecting roads. A Governmental review of speed policy considered the need for the role of speed and accidents on rural roads to be further considered suggesting a framework for individaul classification of roads, taking into account local considerations of the road to implement more suitable speed limits. In  draft guidance for rural roads was presented by the Department for Transport suggesting a blanket reduction in rural single carriageway road speed limits from ph to ph including a reduction to ph for lower quality A and B roads However, this draft guidance has yet to be implemented, and the report archived. likely due to costs involved, blanket implementation likely doesn't justify the cost. Need to rely on more quantiative analysis of individaul roads, cost estimated as Resulting in the current state of a zombified combination of metric and british imperial meassruements.  National speed limits have seen little variation for a number of years, with the majority of roads following the broad criteria for the three main roads types. The three national speed limits are: the mph speed limit on roads with street lighting (sometimes referred to as Restricted Roads) the national speed limit of mph on single carriageway roads the national speed limit of mph on dual carriageways and motorways. These limits are set by the UK government, however local speed limits are determined by local councils.  outline in Setting Local Speed Limits, that national speed limits are not appropriate for all roads, where local road conditions present the requirement for alternative speed limits. The majority of the rural road network in the UK follows the national speed limit of ph for single carriagway roads, and pg for dual carriageway roads, despite driver speed often being far below the speed limit. Noted as especially common on C and Unclassified roads due to the narrow roads, bend, junctions and access. In  an estimated suggest that selecting alternative speed limits for single carriageway rural roads should consider: History of collisions The road's function Existing mean traffic speed Use by vulnerable road users The road's geometry and function The road environment, including roadside development This paper will particualrly focus on the requirement of road geometry The Road Safety Management Capacity Review  outlines the current limitations with road safety management, with the lack of defined and measureable safety performance framework, noting that such a framework should set out the long term goal of total prevention of road deaths and injuries, achevign this through a reducting in average speeds on different road types, and an improvement in emergency response times. This review states that at present there is a distinct lack of both urban and rural road hiararchies, which could be used to better match appropriate speed limits, with function, layout and design. Again, this review notes that posted speed limits often allow for speed far in excess of the design limits of single carriageway rural roads, with inappropriate but alloable speed often a contributing factor in rural accidents. Finally the report calls for a reviw on national speed limits as soon as possible. limitations of the newly introduced spped limit apprasial tool?  This paper will present a method for rural road extraction for a region in the North West of England. The methodology is produced in order to ensure scalability and automation, allowing for replication for any area where data is available. Data used will include road centreline geometries, LiDAR point cloud, and aerial imagery to extract road widths through linear likelihood models. Additionally, this paper aims to extract other features of roads such as elevation changes, surface quality, and the sharpness of bends. These key features aim to provide information that may inform the selection of appropriate speed limits on rural roads, where the ph national speed limit is inappropriate. LiDAR data is collected by emitting rapid laser pulses from an aircraft towards the ground which are reflected back, measuring the distance between the aircraft and surface objects at up to  measurements per second This method produces a set of highly accurate three dimensional points which collectively are known as a LiDAR point 'cloud'. As LiDAR data detects all surface objects, the resultant point cloud produced will include all natural and man made structures, including buildings, roads, trees in addition to the natural variation in the terrain height, known as a digital surface model The main features unique to LiDAR, as opposed to similar aerial data collection techniques such as true colour imagery are outlined below: LiDAR systems record the data by recording emitting a laser pulse which is reflected back at the aircraft by ground objects. If the laser hits a solid object such as ground or a building roof, this laser pulse is entirely reflected back towards the aircraft, giving a single point. However, if the laser pulse hits a soft object such as a tree canopy, the pulse may be partially returned, giving multiple return pulses Therefore, these multiple pulse returns give information regarding objects at an exact  location, but with varying  locations. LiDAR systems also give intensity values for return pulses, which gives information regarding the reflectance of the surface of objects that are hit by the laser pulses. If intensity is given  then reflectance  may be represented as  where  refers to the first pulse signal intensity In addition to  and  coordinates, the distance between the plane and the reflected ground or object is recorded and assigned a  value. Rural roads in the UK are often characterised by dense hedgerows either side, often containing large oak trees which extend over the road surface. In addition to the reduction in corner visibility on these roads, standard aerial imagery suffers from the road surface being obscured by shadows from these trees, and the tree canopy itself. Aerial imagery also often suffers from obstruction due to clouds Due to the inclusion of pulses with modern LiDAR data, the road surface can often be detected through the canopy by selecting the final pulse values, additionally the infrared laser pulses have smaller shadows, due to the narrow scanning angle of LiDAR Non LiDAR imagery often suffers from scene complexity, where road patterns, vehicles and lane markings reduce road heterogeneity The value information provided by LiDAR data allows for the separation of ground and objects on the surface, meaning roads and buildings are often easily separated, despite having similar reflectance (or intensity) Additionally, the reflectance of roads is often homogeneous, and distinctly separate from vegetation LiDAR lacks any texture or spectral information, and often studies in road detection have combined LiDAR with imagery to alleviate this issue with the inclusion of luminescence information to aid with road classification [e.g.][]{charaniya. LiDAR points are distributed irregularly and with varying density, with point density often higher where flight strips overlap and tall objects can occlude points, leaving limited data surrounding trees or buildings.  Often studies use LiDAR height data to identify kerbs to separate streets from pavement however rural roads often have no kerb, and are at the same level as the surrounding vegetation if they are managed grass verges LiDAR data often requires a large amount of processing due to the irregular distribution of points, presence of noise and the number of variables that have to be considered,  note that often papers do not include the computational time for processing this data, which can be time consuming. Produce an automated method using LiDAR and aerial imagery to determine the true width of roads within the chosen study area. Using OS Road and LiDAR Data produce an automated method for determining the characteristic of roads that relate to overall road quality outline above. Assess the potential for speed reduction on rural roads, with the assumption that at present the roads chosen are ph. The site selected in this study was chosen to include a selection of A, B, and Unclassified local roads within a rural setting. Particularly the roads chosen are often partially obscured by tree canopies and do not have visible kerbs, both key features in rural British roads.  figure Additionally the area selection was limited by the availability of LiDAR point cloud data, which is shown on figure.

An overview of the LiDAR data selected for this study is given on Table The variables of primary interest are: Z: The distance a laser pulse is reflected back to to scanner, calculated by the time taken for a return pulse to be detected.

The canopy above roads may be excluded through ignoring early pulses (higher Z values), therefore only the last pulse values for any point are selected, this can be expressed as; where  is a single instance of a LiDAR point within the chosen point cloud,  is the last pulse  coordinate,  the last pulse  coordinate,  the last pulse  coordinate, and  the last pulse intensity value. Ground points were classified using the Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) algorithm, as described in Points were already classified in the data provided, however, as the classification technique was unknown, reclassification was considered necessary. The general implementation simulates the movements of a piece of cloth lying over the inverse of a point cloud, as the point cloud is flipped, the cloth settles beneath ground points, while covering points that lie separate to the ground, essentially forming a digital terrain model (DTM), cloth simulations are described in more detail in The CSF algorithm is given; where is the mass of a single LiDAR point (set to is the time step between points and  represents the gravity constant.  With the classification of ground points, (given a full DTM may be produced through spatial interpolation of the classified points. This process is called normalisation, and ensures that when extracting height information, any observed values are due to objects on the surface of the terrain, and not due to the lie of the terrain itself. Interpolation uses the inverse distance weighting and  nearest neighbours algorithms to produce the DTM. Nearest neighbours were selected as with  for the inverse weighting, and used to produce a DTM with a resolution of This particular technique was selected over more comprehensive methods such as kriging as the number of points is very high, and the small benefit was considered minimal compared with the increase in computational load. The  values from the DTM were then subtracted from the LiDAR point cloud, leaving a normalised point cloud. With the normalised last pulse point cloud, the point cloud was clipped to within a  extent of each known road location, using the OS road shapefiles. Selecting a  extent ensured that even with slight inaccuracy in road location, the road LiDAR points would likely not be excluded. A large number of unimportant points were therefore removed, saving on computational resources. Additionally this extent ensured that both road and non road points were included, but reduced the chance of false positives from occuring as fewer non road points were now included in the analysis. This section combines data extracted through the OS road shapefiles preprocessed LiDAR data, and aerial imagery to obtain a set of creteria to assess the chosen road network.

To exclude as much noise as possible from both the LiDAR point cloud intensity information, and aerial luminescence, only points with the ground classification and points with only a single laser return pulse were included in the models Individual linear probability models were constructed for each sample location for each road, giving results for a cluster of points across a perpendicular segment of each road every Road centrelines were selected as the outcome variable, provided by the OS road network line shapefiles, buffered to  to ensure a three dimensional cross section of points. Additionally, global linear probability models were constructed, and compared against the individual linear models.  Models were constructed using a maximal approach, selecting all appropriate predictor variables, iterating through models by removing variables that did not significantly influence the model outcome, or created noise.  An additional variable  was included, representing the shortest distance from a point to the centreline of the road it is associated with, considering that road points should be weighted more towards points that are closer to the centrepoint of the road.  Predictions for each point were then ran using each model, which gave the likelihood a point was either road or non road. As the likelihood values from the predictions gave a range of numerical values, points that fell below a certain threshold were removed, leaving only points that were most likely correctly identified as road points.

Some maths could be involved. Use to produce speed limit assessment, include steepness somehow (speed limits due to stwwpwnss etc) notes The idea now is to use this information in a more sensitive segmentation, trying to extract the true road extents. Of course, when there is no C(height) or C(inclination) discontinuity at the road boundaries, there is no way de tecting it using laser scan data, and other data sources such as aerial images have to be used. However, the question is how reliable even small discontinuities can be detected. For example, a road may be bounded by an embankment, which usually is a relatively large structure. It may on the other hand be separated from the pavement or a traffic is land by a kerb of only cm in height. This seems to be hopeless, since it is close to the expected noise of the laser measurement. However, if one considers profiles per pendicular to the road, the point is that a m wide road, scanned with m density, will yield measurements to estimate the road surface (assumed to be planar), leading to a standard deviation of about cm cm. Mention logistic regression, considered but not used as results not better and requries a payoff.

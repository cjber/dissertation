Sensitivity analysis, canopy/no canopy.
Limitations, no true zeros, slight limitation, false positives.

Prob threshold, link to Sensitivity analysis. 

Qualitative analysis of accuracy, no true data (limitation of masters)
Determine how error i.e. +.5m already, so not too bad if close to that with the model.

Short introduction, topic, detailed, why is it interesting, couple of articles talking about debate. Talk about the goverment policy. Particular research questions to answer. Assess width of rural roads, sensitivty of that, angles, maybe distance speed thing.
Finally set out structure of dissertation, signposting.

lit review:
in the region of 4k words.
short introduction to the chapter. signposting again. list the order of discussion.
lit review of road safety, road fatalities etc. Road width extraction.
start broad, get narrow, end with the dissertation description.
Broad strategies used for road safety, i.e. where white lines painted etc, other things. how are speed limits set, models? Road detection techniques. 
conclusion of lit review. summarise key points, identify the gaps in the literature to address.

intro to each chaopter, purpose and structure.

results.
Sensitivity analysis, typically before and after, considered analysis. Make sure there are comparisons.

Probably enough, could push it further with stopping distance analysis:
produce polygon for each road.
buffer cirle to stopping distance of 60mph, find where intersects the polygon, see if straight unobstructed line between circle edge and point.

conclusions, key points and findings. limitations, improvements. applications of the study, what can be done differently.


use toy examples in code, use simple example with known angle.

This dissertation presents a methodology for the extraction of road features to enable a fuller understanding of the rural British road network. The method presented considers the requirement for supervised classification of roads to determine road width, that utilises existing OS open road data which is freely available. Concentrating on the practical applications of determining road width enables the use of a sampling classification, which reduces computational load, and enables sample based filtering.

Results generally provide insight into the overall road quality of individual roads in relation to each other, but work is required to more accurately extract key features in road quality assessment, particularly road widths. Further development of this method would provide a method for the national assessment of rural roads in Britain, to aid with improvements with the understanding of rural accessibility, the response time of emergency services, more appropriate speed limits, and rural road hierarchies.

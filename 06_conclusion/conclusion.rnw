This dissertation presents a methodology for the extraction of road features to enable a fuller understanding of the rural British road network. The method presented considers the requirement for supervised classification of roads to determine road width, that utilises existing OS open road data which is freely available. Concentrating on the practical applications of determining road width enables the use of a sampling classification, which reduces computational load, and enables sample based filtering.

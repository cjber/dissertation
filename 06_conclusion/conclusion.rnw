The divide between rural and urban health outcomes has been shown to relate to social mobility and migration of healthier and more socially mobile groups into rural areas, leaving behind less mobile groups in urban settings \citep{riva2011}. Net movement out of rural areas is particularly influenced primarily by young adults moving to urbanised areas \citep{champion2004}. While \cite{riva2011} suggest that social mobility is purely the reason for improved health outcomes in rural England, particularly given there is evidence to suggest that urban centralisation of hospital services should have a negative impact on rural health outcomes \citep{haynes2000,farmer2003}. The question therefore presents itself; what is driving out those with less social mobility, and young adults? Given health outcomes in rural areas are broadly better than those in urban areas, and have been for some time \citep{watt1994}, why do certain groups select urban areas over rural?

  abstract = {The road extraction in urban areas is difficult task due to the complicated patterns and many contextual objects. LiDAR data directly provides three dimensional (3D) points with less occlusions and smaller shadows. The elevation information and surface roughness are distinguishing features to separate roads. However, LiDAR data has some disadvantages are not beneficial to object extraction, such as the irregular distribution of point clouds and lack of clear edges of roads. For these problems, this paper proposes an automatic road centerlines extraction method which has three major steps: (1) road center point detection based on multiple feature spatial clustering for separating road points from ground points, (2) local principal component analysis with least squares fitting for extracting the primitives of road centerlines, and (3) hierarchical grouping for connecting primitives into complete roads network. Compared with MTH (consist of Mean shift algorithm, Tensor voting, and Hough transform) proposed in our previous article, this method greatly reduced the computational cost. To evaluate the proposed method, the Vaihingen data set, a benchmark testing data provided by ISPRS for “Urban Classification and 3D Building Reconstruction” project, was selected. The experimental results show that our method achieve the same performance by less time in road extraction using LiDAR data.},

  abstract = {Separating point clouds into ground and non-ground measurements is an essential step to generate digital terrain models (DTMs) from airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data. However, most ﬁltering algorithms need to carefully set up a number of complicated parameters to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, we present a new ﬁltering method which only needs a few easy-to-set integer and Boolean parameters. Within the proposed approach, a LiDAR point cloud is inverted, and then a rigid cloth is used to cover the inverted surface. By analyzing the interactions between the cloth nodes and the corresponding LiDAR points, the locations of the cloth nodes can be determined to generate an approximation of the ground surface. Finally, the ground points can be extracted from the LiDAR point cloud by comparing the original LiDAR points and the generated surface. Benchmark datasets provided by ISPRS (International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) working Group III/3 are used to validate the proposed ﬁltering method, and the experimental results yield an average total error of 4.58\%, which is comparable with most of the state-of-the-art ﬁltering algorithms. The proposed easy-to-use ﬁltering method may help the users without much experience to use LiDAR data and related technology in their own applications more easily.},

  shorttitle = {Are Area-Based Initiatives Able to Improve Area Safety in Deprived Areas?},
  abstract = {Background: Numerous area-based initiatives have been implemented in deprived areas across Western-Europe with the aim to improve the socio-economic and environmental conditions in these areas. Only few of these initiatives have been scientifically evaluated for their impact on key social determinants of health, like perceived area safety. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of a Dutch area-based initiative called the District Approach on trends in perceived area safety and underlying problems in deprived target districts.
Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used. Repeated cross-sectional data on perceived area safety and underlying problems were obtained from the National Safety Monitor (2005–2008) and its successor the Integrated Safety Monitor (2008–2011). Study population consisted of 133,522 Dutch adults, including 3,595 adults from target districts. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to assess trends in self-reported general safety, physical order, social order, and non-victimization before and after the start of the District Approach mid-2008. Trends in target districts were compared with trends in various control groups.
Results: Residents of target districts felt less safe, perceived less physical and social order, and were victimized more often than adults elsewhere in the Netherlands. For non-victimization, target districts showed a somewhat more positive change in trend after the start of the District Approach than the rest of the Netherlands or other deprived districts. Differences were only statistically significant in women, older adults, and lower educated adults. For general safety, physical order, and social order, there were no differences in trend change between target districts and control groups.
Conclusions: Results suggest that the District Approach has been unable to improve perceptions of area safety and disorder in deprived areas, but that it did result in declining victimization rates.},

Demographic data on area-wide deprivation (the index of multiple deprivation) for each ward was also included. Negative binomial count data models were used to analyze the associations between these factors with traffic fatalities, serious injuries and slight injuries. Results suggest that urbanized areas are associated with fewer casualties (especially fatalities) while areas of higher employment density are associated with more casualties. More deprived areas tend to have higher levels of casualties, though not of motorized casualties (except slight injuries). The effect of road characteristics are less significant but there are some positive associations with the density of “A” and “B” level roads.},

  abstract = {The high pulse frequencies of today’s airborne, mobile and terrestrial laser scanners enable the acquisition of point clouds with densities from some 20-50 points/m2 for airborne scanners to several thousands points/m2 for mobile and terrestrial scanners. For the (semi-)automated extraction of geo-information from point clouds these high point densities are very beneficial. The large number of points on the surfaces of objects to be extracted describe the surface geometry with a high redundancy. This allows the reliable detection of such surfaces in a point cloud. In this paper various examples are presented on how point cloud segmentations can be used to automatically extract geo-information. The paper focusses on the extraction of man-made objects in the urban environment. The examples include the processing of point clouds acquired by airborne, mobile as well as terrestrial laser scanners. The usage of generic knowledge on the objects to be mapped is shown to play a key role in the automation of the point cloud interpretation.},

  title = {A {{Novel Algorithm}} for {{Road Extraction}} from {{Airborne Lidar Data}}},
  abstract = {Road data in 3-dimensional forms is required for a variety of geospatial applications e.g. road maintenance, transport planning and location-based services. Although airborne lidar can produce dense point clouds from which 3-dimensional road information can be retrieved in detail, lidar data is often incomplete due to the line-of-sight requirement, and therefore a better result of information extraction from lidar data can be achieved if supplement data is used. This paper presents a novel algorithm for road extraction from lidar point clouds and associative vector data. A moving window-based classification technique using various cues determined from the lidar data is applied in a hierarchical way to separate road from other objects. In order to fill the gaps caused by the line-of-sight problem e.g. shadows of trees and buildings, the vector data is used in the refinement process to improve the results by including a buffer, deleting false positives, interpolating and fitting the road-representing points into polylines. To validate the proposed algorithm, four samples of lidar data sets are tested. The test result shows that it is a practical method for road extraction from airborne lidar data for both structured and unstructured lanes.},

The varieties of approaches taken by researchers concerned with teasing out the relative importance of geographical factors that may inﬂuence access are examined. To date, in the absence of detailed data on health utilisation patterns, much of this research has focused on developing measures of potential accessibility. This paper then critically evaluates the situation with regard to the use of such measures in a broad range of accessibility studies. In particular, there has been less research to date that examines the relationship between such measures and health outcomes.

  abstract = {Many urban policies aim to improve areas and address socioeconomic deprivation. The resulting investment is often delivered through area-based programmes which incorporate initiatives to improve the physical, social and economic environment. Hypotheses that these investments can contribute to wider public health strategies are based on epidemiological data and used to support the concept of healthy urban policy. However, there is little evidence on their ability to generate positive impacts on socioeconomic or health outcomes. The lack of validating evidence on actual impacts raises two important questions: (1) Is areabased investment an effective strategy to tackle socioeconomic deprivation? (2) What is the prospect for new and improved evaluations to provide stronger evidence? Both the programmes of area investment and their accompanying evaluations have been criticised for being overly ambitious in what can be achieved by the investment and what can be measured by an evaluation. Area-based approaches to tackling deprivation have their advantages but a mix of area and individual-level targeting is likely to be needed. While there is scope to improve the utility of evaluation data there are also inevitable constraints on assessing and attributing impacts from urban investment. The inherent limitations to an area-based approach and the ongoing constraints on impact evaluation will inevitably temper expectations of what healthy urban policy can achieve. However, lack of evidence is not grounds to abandon the concept of healthy urban policy; adoption of more realistic expectations together with improved evaluation data may help to increase its credibility.},

The LIDAR data collected from a nadir direction is a point cloud containing surface samples of not only the building roofs and terrain but also undesirable clutter from trees, cars, etc. The main contribution of this work is the automatic recognition and estimation of simple parametric shapes that can be combined to model very complex buildings from aerial LIDAR data. The main components of the detection and modeling algorithms are (i) Segmentation of roof and terrain points. (ii) Roof topology Inference. We introduce the concept of a roof-topology graph to represent the relationships between the various planar patches of a complex roof structure. (iii) Parametric roof composition. Simple parametric roof shapes that can be combined to create a complex roof structure of a building are recognized by searching for sub-graphs in its roof-topology graph. (iv) Terrain Modeling. The terrain is identiﬁed and modeled as a triangulated mesh. Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the validity of our approach for rapid and automatic building detection and geometric modeling with real LIDAR data.

  title = {Aerial Image Geolocalization from Recognition and Matching of Roads and Intersections},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08323},
  abstract = {Aerial image analysis at a semantic level is important in many applications with strong potential impact in industry and consumer use, such as automated mapping, urban planning, real estate and environment monitoring, or disaster relief. The problem is enjoying a great interest in computer vision and remote sensing, due to increased computer power and improvement in automated image understanding algorithms. In this paper we address the task of automatic geolocalization of aerial images from recognition and matching of roads and intersections. Our proposed method is a novel contribution in the literature that could enable many applications of aerial image analysis when GPS data is not available. We offer a complete pipeline for geolocalization, from the detection of roads and intersections, to the identiﬁcation of the enclosing geographic region by matching detected intersections to previously learned manually labeled ones, followed by accurate geometric alignment between the detected roads and the manually labeled maps. We test on a novel dataset with aerial images of two European cities and use the publicly available OpenStreetMap project for collecting ground truth roads annotations. We show in extensive experiments that our approach produces highly accurate localizations in the challenging case when we train on images from one city and test on the other and the quality of the aerial images is relatively poor. We also show that the the alignment between detected roads and pre-stored manual annotations can be effectively used for improving the quality of the road detection results.},

In this paper, an examination is made of five ways in which property could contribute to urban economic regeneration: through the direct employment effects of construction-related activity; by accommodating the expansion of indigenous firms; by attracting inward investment; by revitalising run-down neighbourhoods; and by initiating areawide economic restructuring. Appropriate property development can have positive economic effects but it has to be part of a more holistic approach that embodies concerns for people living in deprived areas and for the underlying condition of the local economy. Unrestrained market-led development may have detrimental consequences for the economic fabric of cities and for the quality of life of their residents.},

However, in general, this task has been performed by human experts manually, so that it is very costly and time consuming. There have been many attempts at automating this task, but many of the existing works are based on class-speciﬁc features and classiﬁers. In this article, the authors propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based building and road extraction system. This takes raw pixel values in aerial imagery as input and outputs predicted three-channel label images (building–road–background). Using CNNs, both feature extractors and classiﬁers are automatically constructed. The authors propose a new technique to train a single CNN efﬁciently for extracting multiple kinds of objects simultaneously. Finally, they show that the proposed technique improves the prediction performance and surpasses state-of-the-art results tested on a publicly available aerial imagery dataset. c 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.},

In a multilevel modelling analysis, we found mental health was significantly associated with the Townsend score after adjusting for composition, and this effect was strongest in respondents who were economically inactive. Further contextual effects were shown by significant random variability in the slopes of the relation between mental health and economic inactivity at the electoral division level. Our results suggest that the places in which people live affect their mental health, supporting NHS policy that multi-agency planning to reduce inequalities in mental health status should address the wider determinants of health, as well as services for individual patients.},

The most common applications were two-level models where individuals were nested within contexts. Most studies were nonexperimental and used nonprobability samples. The amount of data at each level varied widely across studies, as did the number of models examined. Analyses of reporting practices indicated some clear problems, with many articles not reporting enough information for a reader to critique the reported analyses. For example, in many articles, one could not determine how many models were estimated, what covariance structure was assumed, what type of centering if any was used, whether the data were consistent with assumptions, whether outliers were present, or how the models were estimated.

New Deal for Communities announced in 1998 is one of the most ambitious of English ABIs in that it aims over a period of ten years to close gaps between these thirty-nine areas and national standards in five outcome areas of crime, education, health, worklessness, and housing. Evidence gleaned from the national evaluation of 2002/03 helps illuminate trends and tensions within three themes which have proved central to the wider urban debate: community engagement, partnership working, and the complexity of ABIs. On the broad canvas, evidence from the evaluation suggests that institutional factors continue to impinge strongly on the programme, that the original assumption that partnerships should be given a strong degree of local flexibility and freedoms has been steadily eroded, and that the initiative as a whole sits within that raft of essentially reformist policy interventions effected by the Labour government since 1997.},

Several fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) are then trained to carry out road detection, either by using data from a single sensor, or by using three fusion strategies: early, late, and the newly proposed cross fusion. Whereas in the former two fusion approaches, the integration of multimodal information is carried out at a predeﬁned depth level, the cross fusion FCN is designed to directly learn from data where to integrate information; this is accomplished by using trainable cross connections between the LIDAR and the camera processing branches.},

In the experiments, four LIDAR images with different numbers of areas (sea, forest, desert, and urban) were used for examining the algorithm. The efficiency of image segmentation was generally evaluated visually because the segments of the main image typically lack certain, fixed features and depend on the criterion used for pattern distance/similarity as well as the threshold for cluster separation. For each experiment, hierarchical clustering method was employed by creating the clustering hierarchy tree and specifying the optimal number of clusters on the basis of tree data. Once the optimal number of clusters was determined, the similarity matrix of data image patterns was separated according to Euclidean distance algorithm in terms of greatest similarity among the patterns to the number of clusters. Clustering was then performed. The program output comprised labeled images for samples specifying which pattern pertains to which cluster. The images associated with each cluster are displayed separated from other clusters with other areas eliminated. The results indicated that for LIDAR images that lack a certain, fixed feature, the hierarchical clustering method for segmentation can perform separation and labeling.},

  abstract = {Reliably extracting information from aerial imagery is a difﬁcult problem with many practical applications. One speciﬁc case of this problem is the task of automatically detecting roads. This task is a difﬁcult vision problem because of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of non-road objects. Despite 30 years of work on automatic road detection, no automatic or semi-automatic road detection system is currently on the market and no published method has been shown to work reliably on large datasets of urban imagery. We propose detecting roads using a neural network with millions of trainable weights which looks at a much larger context than was used in previous attempts at learning the task. The network is trained on massive amounts of data using a consumer GPU. We demonstrate that predictive performance can be substantially improved by initializing the feature detectors using recently developed unsupervised learning methods as well as by taking advantage of the local spatial coherence of the output labels. We show that our method works reliably on two challenging urban datasets that are an order of magnitude larger than what was used to evaluate previous approaches.},

Particular attention is given to the role of the level of economic development, public policy and the distribution of economic resources. The study shows that the level of economic development has a strong, but decreasing impact on the infant mortality rate. Income inequality and relative poverty rates appear to be of greater importance for the variation in infant mortality rates than the level of economic development between rich countries. Levels of unemployment and of social security benefits seems to affect the infant mortality rate; the combination of high unemployment and low unemployment benefits seems to be associated with particularly high mortality rates. A high level of family benefits is also associated with low infant mortality rates.},

This paper poses the question as to why part of the discipline turned its back on public policy and particularly issues of poverty and inequality. The aim of the paper is to encourage students and advocates of geography to think a little about what they are involved in (and to think about the role of academia more generally). Recent publications in a number of geography journals have revealed much angst among prominent geographers concerning the state of human geography and, in particular, its links to contemporary policy debate. However, while geographers discuss the debate, we argue that they are not a significant part of it. We take a critical turn and look at the debate that two geographers – Ron Martin and Doreen Massey – have raised within the light of wider debates on public policy, politics, quantification, academia and the policy agenda. We conclude that for many reasons there is unlikely to be a large shift towards policy-orientated research within human geography.},

This study measured the eﬀects of 10 green exercise case studies (including walking, cycling, horse-riding, ﬁshing, canal-boating and conservation activities) in four regions of the UK on 263 participants. Even though these participants were generally an active and healthy group, it was found that green exercise led to a signiﬁcant improvement in self-esteem and total mood disturbance (with anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection and tension-anxiety all improving post-activity). Self-esteem and mood were found not to be aﬀected by the type, intensity or duration of the green exercise, as the results were similar for all 10 case studies. Thus all these activities generated mental health beneﬁts, indicating the potential for a wider health and well-being dividend from green exercise. Green exercise thus has important implications for public and environmental health, and for a wide range of policy sectors.},

Methods: Cox proportional hazards models.
Results: There were large differences in the risk of limiting illness according to occupational social class, with men and women in the least favourable employment conditions nearly four times more likely to become ill than those in the most favourable. Unemployment and economic inactivity also had a powerful effect on illness incidence. Limiting illness was not a permanent state for most participants in the study. Employment status was also related to recovery.
Conclusions: Having secure employment in favourable working conditions greatly reduces the risk of healthy people developing limiting illness. Secure employment increases the likelihood of recovery. These findings have considerable implications for both health inequality and economic policies.},

  abstract = {With the growing prevalence of the dual-earner family model in industrialized countries the gendered nature of the relationship between employment and parenting has become a key issue for childbearing decisions and behavior. In such a context taking into account the societal gender structure (public policies, family-level gender relations) explicitly can enhance our understanding of contemporary fertility trends. In this paper we study the second birth, given its increasing importance in the developed world as large proportions of women remain childless or bear only one child. We focus on Sweden where gender equality is pronounced at both the societal and the family level and on Hungary where the dual-earner model has been accompanied by traditional gender relations in the home sphere. Our analysis is based on data extracted from the Swedish and Hungarian Fertility and Family Surveys of 1992/93. We use the method of hazard regression. The results suggest that the secondbirth intensity increases as the combination of parenthood and labor-force attachment of either parent is facilitated. We see this in the effect of family policies in Sweden and in the higher second-birth intensity of couples who share family responsibilities as compared to those with traditional gender-role behavior in both countries. Also, the lack of any visible impact of men’s educational attainment in both Sweden and Hungary is probably linked to public policies as state support for families with children has reduced the importance of income for second childbearing. A positive educational gradient for Swedish women and an essentially zero gradient in Hungary reﬂects the success of policy measures in reducing fertility cost for more educated women in both countries.},

The first step employed the IDW method to interpolate LiDAR point data (first and last pulses) to achieve DSM, DTM and DNTM layers (at 1 m resolution). For this interpolation RMSE was 0.19 m. In the second step, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to classify the LiDAR data into two classes, road and non-road. For this classification, SVM indicated the merged distance layer with intensity data and yielded better identification of the road position. Assessments of the obtained results showed 63\% correctness, 75\% completeness and 52\% quality of classification. In the next step, road edges were defined in the LiDAR-extracted layers, enabling accurate digitizing of the centerline location. More than 95\% of the LiDAR-derived road was digitized within 1.3 m to the field surveyed normal. The proposed approach can provide thorough and accurate road inventory data to support forest management.},

Our study seeks to assess the relationship between these attributes in residents of the city of Liverpool. Method: Evidence is drawn from a sample survey of 407 adults living in 21 tower blocks. A number of social and psychosocial attributes linked with feelings of safety are compared with self-reported health status using logistic and multiple regression techniques. Possible reciprocal relationships were investigated using two-stage least squares. Results: Fear of crime in this sample is generally much lower in the home than in Britain as a whole and much higher out on the neighbouring streets at night, but there are sub-group variations. We find significant associations between fear of crime and health status. Feelings of safety when out alone after dark is the most consistent predictor of health status. Those feeling safe score significantly higher on all five dimensions of the SF-36 measure which cover mental and social well-being. Mental health is the strongest correlate and is probably a consequence rather than cause of feelings of safety. Conclusion: The evidence suggests elderly residents believe tower blocks provide safe accommodation. However, feelings of safety in these ‘fortresses’ do not generally extend to walking in neighbouring streets. Fear of crime erodes quality of life and is associated with poorer health.},

This paper discusses the most important empirical studies into speed and crash rate with an emphasis on the more recent studies. The majority of these studies looked at absolute speed, either at individual vehicle level or at road section level. Respectively, they found evidence for an exponential function and a power function between speed and crash rate. Both types of studies found evidence that crash rate increases faster with an increase in speed on minor roads than on major roads. At a more detailed level, lane width, junction density, and trafﬁc ﬂow were found to interact with the speed–crash rate relation. Other studies looked at speed dispersion and found evidence that this is also an important factor in determining crash rate. Larger differences in speed between vehicles are related to a higher crash rate. Without exception, a vehicle that moved (much) faster than other trafﬁc around it, had a higher crash rate. With regard to the rate of a (much) slower moving vehicle, the evidence is inconclusive.},

It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques.

We investigated the joint effect of community and individual-level socio-economic deprivation and social cohesion on individual mental health status.
Methods Multilevel analysis of population survey data on 10 653 adults aged 18–74 years nested within the 325 census enumeration districts in Caerphilly county borough, Wales, UK. The outcome measure was the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) subscale of the SF-36 instrument. A social cohesion subscale was derived from a factor analysis of responses to the Neighbourhood Cohesion scale and was modelled at individual and area level. Area income deprivation was measured by the percentage of low income households.
Results Poor mental health was significantly associated with area-level income deprivation and low social cohesion after adjusting for individual risk factors. High social cohesion significantly modified the association between income deprivation and mental health: the difference between the predicted mean area mental health scores at the 10th and 90th centiles of the low income distribution was 3.7 in the low cohesion group and 0.9 in the high cohesion group (difference of the difference in means ¼ 2.8, 95\% CI: 0.2, 5.4).
Conclusions Income deprivation and social cohesion measured at community level are potentially important joint determinants of mental health. Further research on the impact of the social environment on mental health should investigate causal pathways in a longitudinal study.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To synthesise data on the impact on health and key socioeconomic determinants of health and health inequalities reported in evaluations of national UK regeneration programmes. Data Sources: Eight electronic databases were searched from 1980 to 2004 (IBSS, COPAC, HMIC, IDOX, INSIDE, Medline, Urbadisc/Accompline, Web of Knowledge). Bibliographies of located documents and relevant web sites were searched. Experts and government departmental libraries were also contacted. Review methods: Evaluations that reported achievements drawing on data from at least two target areas of a national urban regeneration programme in the UK were included. Process evaluations and evaluations reporting only business outcomes were excluded. All methods of evaluation were included. Impact data on direct health outcomes and direct measures of socioeconomic determinants of health were narratively synthesised.
Results: 19 evaluations reported impacts on health or socioeconomic determinants of health; data from 10 evaluations were synthesised. Three evaluations reported health impacts; in one evaluation three of four measures of self reported health deteriorated, typically by around 4\%. Two other evaluations reported overall reductions in mortality rates. Most socioeconomic outcomes assessed showed an overall improvement after regeneration investment; however, the effect size was often similar to national trends. In addition, some evaluations reported adverse impacts.
Conclusion: There is little evidence of the impact of national urban regeneration investment on socioeconomic or health outcomes. Where impacts have been assessed, these are often small and positive but adverse impacts have also occurred. Impact data from future evaluations are required to inform healthy public policy; in the meantime work to exploit and synthesise ‘‘best available’’ data is required.},

  abstract = {A method for the automatic detection and vectorization of roads from lidar data is presented. To extract roads from a lidar point cloud, a hierarchical classification technique is used to classify the lidar points progressively into road and non-road points. During the classification process, both intensity and height values are initially used. Due to the homogeneous and consistent nature of roads, a local point density is introduced to finalize the classification. The resultant binary classification is then vectorized by convolving a complex-valued disk named the Phase Coded Disk (PCD) with the image to provide three separate pieces of information about the road. The centerline and width of the road are obtained from the resultant magnitude image while the direction is determined from the corresponding phase image, thus completing the vectorized road model. All algorithms used are described and applied to two urban test sites. Completeness values of 0.88 and 0.79 and correctness values of 0.67 and 0.80 were achieved for the classification phase of the process. The vectorization of the classified results yielded RMS values of 1.56 m and 1.66 m, completeness values of 0.84 and 0.81 and correctness values of 0.75 and 0.80 for two different data sets.},

While significant progress has been made in the extraction of buildings and trees from dense point clouds, little research has been performed on the extraction of roads. In this paper it is analysed to what extent road sides can be mapped in point clouds of high point density (20 pts/m2). In urban areas curbstones often separate the road surface from the adjacent pavement. These curbstones are mapped in a three step procedure. First, the locations with small height jumps near the terrain surface are detected. Second, midpoints of high and low points on either side of the height jump are generated, put in a sequence, and used to fit a smooth curve. Third, small gaps between nearby and collinear line segments are closed. GPS measurements were taken to analyse the performance of the road side detection. The analysis showed that the completeness varied between 50 and 86\%, depending on the amount of parked cars occluding the curbstones. The RMSE in the comparison with the GPS measurements was 0.18 m.},

  title = {Cost-Effective Measures to Improve Crash and Injury Risk at Rural Intersections.},
  abstract = {Crashes on rural roads are a major road safety problem, accounting for up to twothirds of deaths and serious injuries worldwide. Rural intersections, in particular, are dangerous locations, accounting for over 30 percent of these rural crashes. Most collisions at intersections occur in high-speed settings, at intersections that are uncontrolled or controlled by stop or give-way signs, and often on low-volume, single-carriageway roads. This paper provides an overview of a systematic review of international literature, identifies ‘best-practice’ measures to reduce crash and injury risk at rural intersections and describes cutting-edge strategies and evaluation of infrastructure measures for managing safety at rural intersections. Cost-effective measures include: measures to reduce speed and speeding and the injury consequences, speed perception measures, roundabouts, traffic signals, gradeseparation, channelisation, signing to clarify priority, removal of sight distance obstructions, provision of medians, skid-resistant pavements and limited access from side roads and driveways. The paper highlights the need to address key crash problems at rural intersections by developing and implementing a system-wide and comprehensive approach that fundamentally improves the operation and design of these locations.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial optical images as well as coregistered LiDAR data opens great opportunities for improving objectlevel dense semantic labeling of airborne remote sensing imagery. As a result, efﬁcient and effective multisensor fusion techniques are needed to fully exploit these complementary data modalities. Recent researches demonstrated how to process remote sensing images using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) at the feature level. In this paper, we propose a decision-level fusion approach using a probabilistic graphical model for the task of dense semantic labeling. Our proposed method ﬁrst obtains two initial probabilistic labeling predictions from a fully-convolutional neural network and a linear classiﬁer, e.g. logistic regression, respectively. These two predictions are then combined within a higher-order conditional random ﬁeld (CRF). We utilize graph cut inference to estimate the ﬁnal dense semantic labeling results. Higher-order CRF modeling helps to resolve fusion ambiguities by explicitly using the spatial contextual information, which can be learned from the training data. Experiments on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling Potsdam dataset show that our proposed approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

The essence of generalization is reducing details while enhancing important features at the same time; so for the purpose of terrain surface visualization special attention has to be given to the enhancement and generalization of topographic objects like dams, roads etc. The focus of this work is laid on the extraction of road objects and their contribution into the enhancement of the generalized terrain model. An algorithm for the extraction of roads is developed and is followed by a generalization algorithm that weights together road networks and filtered LiDAR point clouds. Following the presentation of the algorithm results for this approach are shown and evaluated.},

Drawing from a major cross-disciplinary investigation of food access and food poverty in British cities, the authors report in this paper findings from the first `before/after' study of food consumption in a highly deprived area of a British city experiencing a sudden and significant change in its food-retail access. The study has been viewed as the first opportunity in the United Kingdom to assess the impact of a non-healthcare intervention (specifically a retail-provision intervention) on food-consumption patterns, and by extension diet-related health, in such a deprived, previously poor-retail-access community. The paper offers evidence of a positive but modest impact of the retail intervention on diet, and the authors discuss the ways in which their findings are potentially significant in the context of policy debate.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at investigating whether the relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation is aﬀected by the spatial autocorrelation of ecological data. A simple model is used in which mortality (all-ages and premature) is the dependent variable, and deprivation, morbidity and other socio-economic indicators are the explanatory variables. Deprivation is measured by the Townsend index; the other socio-economic variables are the median income, unequal income distribution (Gini coeﬃcient) and population density. Morbidity is estimated on the basis of hospital admission rates and overweight prevalence. Spatial autocorrelation is measured by the Moran’s I coeﬃcient. All mortality and morbidity variables have signiﬁcant, positive, and moderate-to-high spatial autocorrelation. Two multivariate models are explored: a weighted least-squares model ignoring spatial autocorrelation and a simultaneous autoregressive model. The paper concludes that spatial autocorrelation has a signiﬁcant impact on the relationship between mortality and socio-economic variables. Future ecological models intended to inform health resources allocation need to pay greater attention to the spatial dimension of the data used. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper examines dependence on the car in rural Scotland, assesses the impact of the fuel duty escalator on rural communities and discusses the role of the new Scottish Executive in shaping future rural transport policy. Questionnaires, interviews and travel diaries were used in "ve areas and revealed that households in rural Scotland enjoy high levels of car ownership, and that the car is used for over three-quarters of all journeys. Isolation and income levels are the most signi"cant predictors of car use. Those living in \&removed' areas * i.e. locations distant from main roads and/or bus routes * are more likely to own vehicles and make a higher proportion of their journeys by car. A\%uent households enjoy higher levels of car ownership, and make more journeys over greater distances by this mode than those on low-incomes. Less a\%uent households are also more likely to have disposed of a vehicle without replacing it, suggesting a more \#uctuating dependence on the car. Although those living in rural Scotland appear to count on the car, a distinction is made between those who have no alternative (structurally dependent) and those who have alternatives but rely on their vehicles. It is di\$cult to predict the exact impact of the fuel duty escalator, but it is argued that the majority of households will cope with increases in the cost of motoring, while a signi"cant minority of low income households in isolated areas will struggle to absorb the extra cost. The study highlights the need for the Scottish legislature to secure additional funding in order to sustain rural communities in the face of the rising fuel costs and suggests that an appropriate policy response might be to support isolated shops and services, i.e. subsidising alternatives to the journey as well as alternatives to the car. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For detection of roads, segmentations based on normal direction, edge detection and height difference are used.

  title = {{{AUTOMATIC ROAD EXTRACTION FROM DENSE URBAN AREA BY INTEGRATED PROCESSING OF HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGERY AND LIDAR DATA}}},
  abstract = {Automated and reliable 3D city model acquisition is an increasing demand. Automatic road extraction from dense urban areas is a challenging issue due to the high complex image scene. From imagery, the obstacles of the extraction stem mainly from the difficulty of finding clues of the roads and complexity of the contextual environments. One of the promising methods to deal with this is to use data sources from multi-sensors, by which the multiple clues and constraints can be obtained so that the uncertainty can be minimized significantly. This paper focuses on the integrated processing of high resolution imagery and LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data for automatic extraction of grid structured urban road network. Under the guidance of an explicit model of the urban roads in a grid structure, the method firstly detects the primitives or clues of the roads and the contextual targets (i.e., parking lots, grasslands) both from the color image and lidar data by segmentation and image analysis. Evidences of road existing are contained in the primitives. The candidate road stripes are detected by an iterative Hough transform algorithm. This is followed by an procedure of evidence finding and validation by taking advantage of high resolution imagery and direct height information of the scene derived from lidar data. Finally the road network is formed by topology analysis. In this paper, the strategy and corresponding algorithms are described. The test data set is color ortho-imagery with 0.5 m resolution and lidar data of Toronto downtown area. The experimental results in the typical dense urban scene indicate it is able to extract the roads much more reliable and accurate by the integrated processing than by using imagery or lidar separately. It saliently exhibits advantages of the integrated processing of the multiple data sources for the road extraction from the complicated scenes.},

  abstract = {In this paper an eﬃcient method for automatic road extraction in rural and semi-urban areas is presented. This work seeks the GIS update starting from color images and using preexisting vectorial information. As input data only the RGB bands of a satellite or aerial color image of high resolution is required. The system includes four diﬀerent modules: data preprocessing; binary segmentation based on three levels of texture statistical evaluation; automatic vectorization by means of skeletal extraction; and ﬁnally a module for system evaluation. In the ﬁrst module the color image is rectiﬁed and geo-referenced. The second module uses a new technique, named Texture Progressive Analysis (TPA), in order to obtain the segmented binary image. The TPA technique is developed in the evidence theory framework, and it consists in fusing information streaming from three diﬀerent sources for the image. In the third module the obtained binary image is vectorized using an algorithm based on skeleton extraction techniques and morphological methods. The result is an extracted road network which is deﬁned as a structural set of elements geometrically and topologically corrects. The fourth module is an evaluation of the procedure using a popular method. Experimental results show that this method is eﬃcient in extracting and deﬁning road networks from high resolution satellite and aerial imagery.},

The author examines the geographical concentration of deprivation, the extent, and whether there is a polarisation between areas. The evidence confirms that there is a clear rationale for area-based approaches, although it should not be assumed that they will be the most effective means to improve conditions in all cases. The evidence suggests that there should be a closer link between area-based approaches and national level main programmes, given the time limited nature of the former and the fact that they only reach a minority of all deprived people. The issues involved in identifying target areas are also reviewed including the question of who decides and on what basis. It is concluded that understanding the spatial distribution of deprivation is crucial and that there is an urgent need for better, more up to date statistical and other data relating to small geographical areas.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial mobile laser scanning systems provide rapid and cost effective 3D point cloud data which can be used for extracting features such as the road edge along a route corridor. This information can assist road authorities in carrying out safety risk assessment studies along road networks. The knowledge of the road edge is also a prerequisite for the automatic estimation of most other road features. In this paper, we present an algorithm which has been developed for extracting left and right road edges from terrestrial mobile LiDAR data. The algorithm is based on a novel combination of two modiﬁed versions of the parametric active contour or snake model. The parameters involved in the algorithm are selected empirically and are ﬁxed for all the road sections. We have developed a novel way of initialising the snake model based on the navigation information obtained from the mobile mapping vehicle. We tested our algorithm on different types of road sections representing rural, urban and national primary road sections. The successful extraction of road edges from these multiple road section environments validates our algorithm. These ﬁndings and knowledge provide valuable insights as well as a prototype road edge extraction toolset, for both national road authorities and survey companies.},

  abstract = {This essay seeks to reframe recent debates on sociospatial theory through the introduction of an approach that can grasp the inherently polymorphic, multidimensional character of sociospatial relations. As previous advocates of a scalar turn, we now question the privileging, in any form, of a single dimension of sociospatial processes, scalar or otherwise. We consider several recent sophisticated `turns' within critical social science; explore their methodological limitations; and highlight several important strands of sociospatial theory that seek to transcend the latter. On this basis, we argue for a more systematic recognition of polymorphyöthe organization of sociospatial relations in multiple formsöwithin sociospatial theory. Specifically, we suggest that territories (T), places (P), scales (S), and networks (N) must be viewed as mutually constitutive and relationally intertwined dimensions of sociospatial relations. We present this proposition as an extension of recent contributions to the spatialization of the strategic-relational approach (SRA), and we explore some of its methodological implications. We conclude by briefly illustrating the applicability of the `TPSN framework' to several realms of inquiry into sociospatial processes under contemporary capitalism.},

impact upon those patients who live at a distance from their hospital, and this impact has not been well reported or researched, but 
studies have demonstrated that the utilisation of services is inversely related to the distance of the patient from the hospital; so-called 
‘distance decay’. This article examines the trend and describes the reasons for it, and the impact on those living in remote and rural 
communities. It argues that health service planning needs to be patient centred, and points out that, although providing services to 
rural communities is more expensive than that for urban populations, a balance needs to be struck between cost-effectiveness and 
the provision of accessible and equitable services for all of our patients. It argues for a debate to help define where that balance point 
should be, and makes certain recommendations. This debate is especially important, because the professions urgently need to decide},

  abstract = {Green spaces play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological and social systems, a fact recognised in public policy commitments in both the UK and Europe. The amount of provision, the distribution of green space and the ease of access to such spaces are key contributors to social and ecological function in urban environments. We measured distance along the transport network to public green space available to households in Shefﬁeld, and compared this with the distribution of private garden space. In addition, we used a geodemographic database, Mosaic UK, to examine how access to green space varies across different sectors of society. Public green spaces are chronically underprovided relative to recommended targets. For example, 64\% of Shefﬁeld households fail to meet the recommendation of the regulatory agency English Nature (EN), that people should live no further than 300 m from their nearest green space. Moreover, this ﬁgure rises to 72\% if we restrict attention to municipal parks recognised by the local council. There is an overall reduction in coverage by green space when moving from neighbourhoods where green space is primarily publicly provided to those where it is privately provided. While access to public green space varies signiﬁcantly across different social groups, those enjoying the greatest access include more deprived groups and older people. This study highlights the need for additional green space to be created and existing green space to be protected in light of increasing development pressure.},

  doi = {10/ddfwxg},
  abstract = {This paper looks at demand issues in gentriﬁcation. It takes as its basic proposition that everyone involved in the demand side belongs to the same economic class and therefore possesses the same set of motivations; that ‘otherness’ in gentriﬁcation is something that needs to be problematised rather than assumed. It argues that the presumption of otherness arises because accounts of demand for gentriﬁcation begin at the end, from achieved housing situation, and argue back, rather than at the beginning, with means. The motivations of gentriﬁers, suburbanites and displacees are the same, a concern for deﬁning and preserving identity in the modern world: what differ between them are the means at the disposal of each group. Concern with identity means taking seriously the importance of fashion in gentriﬁcation: gentriﬁers and suburbanites are members of different status groups, using housing as status symbols to deﬁne and claim membership of those groups. Displacees are just as concerned with the maintenance of their identity, but do not have access to the same amount of resources as gentriﬁers. Because the solution to the gentriﬁers’ identity crisis takes place at the expense of the displacee, gentriﬁcation takes on a synecdochal quality: the concerns expressed in struggles over gentriﬁcation exemplify the general concern with identity in conditions of modernity, which should be understood as the subjective experience of everyday life within a capitalist mode of production. The context within which these struggles over status take place is nonetheless class-constituted and class-laden. Gentriﬁcation and the struggles it engenders should be interpreted as a form of hegemonic practice. Ultimately, it is this that makes gentriﬁcation ‘gentriﬁcation’.},

  abstract = {College education has a positive impact on birth rates, net of age and duration since previous birth, according to models estimated separately for second and third births. There are also indications of such effects on first-birth rates, in the upper 20s and 30s. Whereas a high fertility among the better-educated perhaps could be explained by socioeconomic or ideational factors, it might just as well be a result of selection. When all three parity transitions are modelled jointly, with a common unobserved factor included, negative effects of educational level appear. On the whole, the effects are less clearly negative for women born in the 1950s than for those born in the 1940s or late 1930s. The cohorts from the 1950s show educational differentials in completed fertility that are quite small and to a large extent stem from a higher proportion of childlessness among the better-educated. Second-birth progression ratios are just as high for the college educated as for women with only compulsory education, and the third-birth progression ratios differ very little. This reflects weakly negative net effects of education after first birth and spill-over effects from the higher age at first birth, counterbalanced by differential selectivity of earlier parity transitions.},

  abstract = {Although levels of fertility in most sub-Saharan Africa have not shown significant trends in the past few decades, substantial fertility differentials exist between countries and between regions and socioeconomic groups within countries. This paper examines the proximate determinants of fertility that are responsible for these variations in fertility. Particular attention is given to the biological and behavioral factors, such as postpartum abstinence, prolonged breastfeeding, and pathological sterility, which are crucial determinants of fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a simple analytic model, the relative fertility-inhibiting effects of the proximate determinants are quantified, and from this analysis an assessment is made of prospects for future trends in fertility. It is concluded that rapid declines in fertility are unlikely to occur in the near future, partly because desired family size is very high and partly because upward pressure on fertility levels will result from the erosion of traditional childspacing practices of postpartum abstinence and prolonged breastfeeding or from declines in levels of pathological sterility in response to public health measures.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Reconfiguration of emergency services could lead to patients with life-threatening conditions travelling longer distances to hospital. Concerns have been raised that this could increase the risk of death. We aimed to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality in patients with lifethreatening emergencies.
Methods: We undertook an observational cohort study of 10 315 cases transported with a potentially lifethreatening condition (excluding cardiac arrests) by four English ambulance services to associated acute hospitals, to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality, after adjustment for age, sex, clinical category and illness severity.
Results: Straight-line ambulance journey distances ranged from 0 to 58 km with a median of 5 km, and 644 patients died (6.2\%). Increased distance was associated with increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.02 per kilometre; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.03; p,0.001). This association was not changed by adjustment for confounding by age, sex, clinical category or illness severity. Patients with respiratory emergencies showed the greatest association between distance and mortality.
Conclusion: Increased journey distance to hospital appears to be associated with increased risk of mortality. Our data suggest that a 10-km increase in straight-line distance is associated with around a 1\% absolute increase in mortality.},

In an investigation of the parameter estimates from a multiple linear regression model and a multiple logit regression model, conclusions are drawn about the sensitivity of such estimates to variations in scale and zoning systems. The modifiable areal unit problem is shown to be essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis and is therefore a much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis. The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units. Given that such analyses can only be expected to increase with the imminent availability of new census data both in the United Kingdom and in the USA, and the current proliferation of GIS (geographical information system) technology which permits even more access to aggregated data, this paper serves as a topical warning.},

After initial discussion on the nature of spatial data, including the concept of randomness, we focus most of our attention on linear regression models that involve interactions between agents across space. The introduction of spatial variables in to standard linear regression provides a flexible way of characterising these interactions, but complicates both interpretation and estimation of parameters of interest. The estimation of these models leads to three fundamental challenges: the reflection problem, the presence of omitted variables and problems caused by sorting. We consider possible solutions to these problems, with a particular focus on restrictions on the nature of interactions. We show that similar assumptions are implicit in the empirical strategies - fixed effects or spatial differencing - used to address these problems in reduced form estimation. These general lessons carry over to the policy evaluation literature.},

  abstract = {A method for the automatic detection of roads from airborne laser scanner data is presented. Traditionally, intensity information has not been used in feature extraction from LIDAR data because the data is too noisy. This article deals with using as much of the recorded laser information as possible thus both height and intensity are used. To extract roads from a LIDAR point cloud, a hierarchical classiﬁcation technique is used to classify the LIDAR points progressively into road or non-road. Initially, an accurate digital terrain model (DTM) model is created by using successive morphological openings with different structural element sizes. Individual laser points are checked for both a valid intensity range and height difference from the subsequent DTM. A series of ﬁlters are then passed over the road candidate image to improve the accuracy of the classiﬁcation. The success rate of road detection and the level of detail of the resulting road image both depend on the resolution of the laser scanner data and the types of roads expected to be found. The presence of road-like features within the survey area such as private roads and car parks is discussed and methods to remove this information are entertained. All algorithms used are described and applied to an example urban test site.},

These surveys have led to the expectation that, sooner or later, period fertility would recover in Europe. The most recent data from the Eurobarometer 2001 survey, however, suggest that in the German-speaking parts of Europe the average ideal family sizes given by younger men and women have fallen as low as 1.7 children.

This will make it harder for a low- and moderate-income households to live near the projects, and neighborhoods are likely to become increasingly aﬄuent. The Atlanta Beltline will ultimately connect 45 Atlanta neighborhoods via a 22-mile loop of trails, parks, and eventually a streetcar, all of which follow abandoned railroad tracks. This paper examines the eﬀect of the Beltline on housing values within one half mile. From 2011 to 2015, depending on the segment of the Beltline, values rose between 17.9 percent and 26.6 percent more for homes within a half-mile of the Beltline than elsewhere.

  abstract = {Clothing is a fundamental part of a character’s persona, a key storytelling tool used to convey an intended impression to the audience. Draping, folding, wrinkling, stretching, etc. all convey meaning, and thus each is carefully controlled when ﬁlming live actors. When making ﬁlms with computer simulated cloth, these subtle but important elements must be captured. In this paper we present several methods essential to matching the behavior and look of clothing worn by digital stand-ins to their real world counterparts. Novel contributions include a mixed explicit/implicit time integration scheme, a physically correct bending model with (potentially) nonzero rest angles for pre-shaping wrinkles, an interface forecasting technique that promotes the development of detail in contact regions, a post-processing method for treating cloth-character collisions that preserves folds and wrinkles, and a dynamic constraint mechanism that helps to control large scale folding. The common goal of all these techniques is to produce a cloth simulation with many folds and wrinkles improving the realism.},

  abstract = {Roads are essential component of topographic maps and spatial databases. The challenge in automated generalisation of road networks is to derive a connected network while maintaining the structure for the intended target scale and to achieve this with minimum user intervention. A lot of methods to select, displace and simplify roads have been presented; the focus here is on the generalisation of networks using visual perception techniques. This paper presents a framework based on visual perception that uses minimum attributes for generalisation of both ‘rural’ and ‘urban’ roads over large scale change. The system incorporated graph theoretic techniques to explicitly model the topology of the network as it was generalized. The model uses a fine scale map (1:1250 or 1:2500) as input and generates small scale (1:250,000) maps directly from it without creating intermediate small scale maps. The results compared favorably with paper maps (Ordnance Surveys Stratgie dataset (1:250,000)).},

Road marking is a signalization present on road surfaces and commonly used to inform the correct lane cars must keep. Cameras have been widely used for road marking detection, however they are sensible to environment illumination. Some LIDAR sensors return infrared reﬂective intensity information which is insensible to illumination condition. Existing road marking detectors that analyzes reﬂective intensity data focus only on lane markings and ignores other types of signalization. We propose a road marking detector based on Otsu thresholding method that make possible segment LIDAR point clouds into asphalt and road marking. The results show the possibility of detecting any road marking (crosswalks, continuous lines, dashed lines). The road marking detector has also been integrated with Monte Carlo localization method so that its performance could be validated. According to the results, adding road markings onto curb maps lead to a lateral localization error of 0.3119 m.},

It is basic information for further analysis in several applications including road surface settlement, pavement condition assessment and slope collapse. Mobile LiDAR system (MLS) is frequently used now a days to collect detail road surface and its surrounding information in terms three-dimensional (3D) point cloud. Extraction of road surface from volumetric point cloud data is still in infancy stage because of heavy data processing requirement and the complexity in the road environment. The extraction of roads especially rural road, where road-curb is not present is very tedious job especially in Indian roadway settings. Only a few studies are available, and none for Indian roads, in the literature for rural road detection. The limitations of existing studies are in terms of their lower accuracy, very slow speed of data processing and detection of other objects having similar characteristics as the road surface. A fast and accurate method is proposed for LiDAR data points of road surface detection, keeping in mind the essence of road surface extraction especially for Indian rural roads. The Mobile LiDAR data in XYZI format is used as input in the proposed method. First square gridding is performed and ground points are roughly extracted. Then planar surface detection using mathematical framework of principal component analysis (PCA) is performed and further road surface points are detected using similarity in intensity and height difference of road surface pointe in their neighbourhood.},

Owing to the advancements in the ﬁeld of high-resolution remote sensing, and the success of semantic segmentation success using deep learning in computer version, extracting the road network from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly popular, and has become a new tool to update the geospatial database. Considering that the training dataset of the deep convolutional neural network will be clipped to a ﬁxed size, which lead to the roads run through each sample, and that different kinds of road types have different widths, this work provides a segmentation model that was designed based on densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) and introduces the local and global attention units. The aim of this work is to propose a novel road extraction method that can efﬁciently extract the road network from remote sensing imagery with local and global information. A dataset from Google Earth was used to validate the method, and experiments showed that the proposed deep convolutional neural network can extract the road network accurately and effectively. This method also achieves a harmonic mean of precision and recall higher than other machine learning and deep learning methods.},

Then, buildings and trees were distinguished in an energy minimization framework after incorporation of two new features. The separation provided supportive information for later road extractions. After that, we designed structure templates to search for roads on ground intensity images, and road widths and orientations were determined by a subsequent voting scheme. This local searching process produced road candidates only, in order to prune false positives and infer undetected roads, a scene-dependent Markov network was constructed to help infer a global road network. Combination of local template fitting and global MRF inference made extracted ground roads more accurate and complete. Finally, we extended developed methods to elevated roads extraction from non-ground points and combined them with the ground road network to formulate a whole network.},

Fine-grained descriptions of geographical information is a key resource in ﬁelds such as social-economic studies, urban and regional planning, transport planning, or environmental impact analysis. One such method for spacial disaggregation is the dissever algorithm, a hybrid approach that combines pycnophylactic interpolation and regression-based dasymetric mapping, leveraging auxiliary data to increase desegregation precision. Implemented in R, the current dissever version assumes a sequential execution model and the usage of smaller-than-ram computational sequences, limiting the resolution and scale of usable datasets. This paper presents a variant of the dissever algorithm, called S-Dissever (Scalable Dissever) suitable for eﬃciently executing in parallel environments, taking advantage of modern multi-core architectures, while using secondary memory to scale out computations that exceed RAM capacity. Experimental evaluations on the S-Dissever demonstrate the feasibility of the desegregation procedure while using high-resolution auxiliary data at signiﬁcant geographical extents, as well as notable speedups obtained by the utilization of multi-core environments.},

The study ﬁndings reveal that seaside districts, wards and resorts are experiencing higher levels of multiple deprivation than might be expected. In addition, it shows that while there is remarkable similarity in the nature and extent of multiple deprivation being experienced, variations in the socio-economic characteristics of those resorts most affected suggest that their predicament is more complex than ﬁrst appears. Three important implications for resort restructuring are highlighted. First, it must avoid being too tourism centric and instead should adopt a more holistic approach. Second a ‘one size ﬁt’ approach is inappropriate and third, there is an urgent need for further in-depth research.},

Religion is important in the life of one-half of US women, whereas not even for one of six Europeans. By every available measure, American women are more religious than European women. Catholic and Protestant women have notably higher fertility than those not belonging to any denomination in the US and across Europe. In all European regions and in the United States as well as among all denominations the more devout have more children. However, women in Northern and Western Europe who are the least religious have equivalent or even higher fertility than women in the US, and notably higher fertility than those in Southern Europe. This suggests that forces other than religion and religiousness are also important in their impact on childbearing. A multivariate analysis demonstrates that relatively ‘‘traditional’’ socioeconomic covariates (age, marital status, residence, education, and income) do not substantially change the positive association of religiousness and fertility. Finally, if Europeans were as religious as Americans one might theoretically expect a small fertility increase for Europe as a whole, but considerably more for Western Europe.},

  abstract = {The road networks provide key information for a broad range of applications such as urban planning, urban management, and navigation. The fast-developing technology of remote sensing that acquires high-resolution observational data of the land surface offers opportunities for automatic extraction of road networks. However, the road networks extracted from remote sensing images are likely affected by shadows and trees, making the road map irregular and inaccurate. This research aims to improve the extraction of road centerlines using both very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) by accounting for road connectivity. The proposed method ﬁrst applies the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) to segment remote sensing images into image objects and then classiﬁes image objects using the machine learning classiﬁer, random forest. A post-processing approach based on the minimum area bounding rectangle (MABR) is proposed and a structure feature index is adopted to obtain the complete road networks. Finally, a multistep approach, that is, morphology thinning, Harris corner detection, and least square ﬁtting (MHL) approach, is designed to accurately extract the road centerlines from the complex road networks. The proposed method is applied to three datasets, including the New York dataset obtained from the object identiﬁcation dataset, the Vaihingen dataset obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 2D semantic labelling benchmark and Guangzhou dataset. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can obtain the highest completeness, correctness, and quality for the three datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is an efﬁcient solution for extracting road centerlines in complex scenes from VHR aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data.},

Then, for all the training image pixels which have corresponding Lidar points, we extract their features from color image and Lidar point clouds, respectively, and use these features together with the location features to train an Adaboost classifier. After that, all the testing pixels are classified into road or non-road under a conditional random field framework. In this conditional random field framework, we use the scores computed from the Adaboost classifier as the unary potential and take the height value of each pixel and its color information into consideration together for the pairwise potential. Finally, experimental tests have been carried out on the KITTI Road data set, and the results show that our method performs well on this data set.},

Conventional lane detection methods are limited to simple road conditions and are not suitable for complex urban roads with various road signs on the ground. Given a 3D point cloud scanned by a 3D LiDAR sensor, we categorized the points of the drivable region and distinguished the points of the road signs on the ground. Then, we developed an expectation-maximization method to detect parallel lines and update the 3D line parameters in real time, as the probe vehicle equipped with the LiDAR sensor moved forward. The detected and recorded line parameters were integrated to build a lane-level digital map with the help of a GPS/INS sensor. The proposed system was tested to generate accurate lane-level maps of two complex urban routes. The experimental results showed that the proposed system was fast and practical in terms of effectively detecting road lines and generating lane-level maps.},

  abstract = {The extraction of road network is an emerging area in information extraction from high-resolution satellite images (HRSI). It is also an interesting field that incorporates various tactics to achieve road network. The process of road detection from remote sensing images is quite complex, due to the presence of various noises. These noises could be the vehicles, crossing lines and toll bridges. Few small and large false road segments interrupt the extraction of road segments that happens due to the similar spectral behavior in heterogeneous objects. To achieve a better level of accuracy, numerous factors play their important role, such as spectral data of satellite sensor and the information related to land surface area. Therefore the interpretation varies on processing of images with different heuristic parameters. These parameters have tuned according to the road characteristics of the terrain in satellite images. There are several approaches proposed and implemented to extract the roads from HRSI comprising a single or hybrid method. This kind of hybrid approach has also improved the accuracy of road extraction in comparison to a single approach. Some characteristics related to impervious and non-impervious surfaces are used as salient features that help to improve the extraction of road area only in the correct manner. These characteristics also used to utilize the spatial, spectral and texture features to increase the accuracy of classified results. Therefore, aforesaid characteristics have been utilized in combination of road spectral properties to extract road network only with improved accuracy. This evaluated road network is quite accurate with the help of these defined methodologies.},

  abstract = {Lidar is an eﬃcient tool for remotely monitoring targets or objects, but the eﬀective range is often limited by signalto-noise ratio (SNR). The reason is that noises or interferences always badly aﬀect the measured results. So, to detect the weak signals buried in noises is a fundamental and important problem in the Lidar systems. It has been found that digital ﬁlters are not suitable for processing Lidar signals in noises, while the wavelet transform is an eﬃcient tool for signal analysis in time–frequency domain that is very sensitive to the transient signals. In this paper, we propose a new method of the Lidar signal acquisition based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT). This method can signiﬁcantly improve the SNR so that the eﬀective measured range of Lidar is increased. The performance for our method is investigated by detecting the simulating and real Lidar signals in white noise. To contrast, the results of Butterworth ﬁlter, which is a kind of ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) ﬁlter, are also demonstrated. Finally, the experimental results show that our approach outperforms the traditional methods.},

  abstract = {This note is intended to rectify estimates provided in a previous paper (Wong et al., 2006) of the shortterm effectiveness in terms of road fatality reduction of the setting of quantiﬁed road safety targets using data from 14 OECD countries during the period 1980–1999. This work is important in measuring the association between target setting and road safety improvement, because such targets are intended to serve as a useful tool to motivate timely road safety measures by the road authorities and others. The estimates to be rectiﬁed were based on before-and-after analysis using a comparison group of countries for each country that had set a target. This note ﬁrst provides a correction to the qualiﬁcation test for the inclusion of a country in any particular comparison group. It then presents the numerical effects of this correction on the estimates of the effectiveness of setting quantiﬁed road safety targets, both in individual countries and across the whole group of countries that set targets in the relevant period. Finally, impacts on the ﬁndings of the previous paper are discussed, with the conclusion that the changes in those of the numerical estimates that are affected do not alter the main message of the paper.},
